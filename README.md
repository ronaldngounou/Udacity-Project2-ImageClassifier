# Udacity-Project2-ImageClassifier
Train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers, then export it for use in a stand alone application.

## Overview
In this project, I will train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers, then export it for use in a stand alone application.
This project was completed as part of Udacity's [AI Programming with Python Nanodegree](/https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089?utm_source=gsem_brand&utm_medium=ads_r&utm_campaign=12949497746_c_individuals&utm_term=130336583708&utm_keyword=%2Bnanodegree%20%2Bpython%20%2Bai_b&gclid=CjwKCAiAyfybBhBKEiwAgtB7fl8mGnollqsIAzZLMhV1pMoopbYcaqvkK5ivRsTLajINWVHjGCId_xoCs0oQAvD_BwE) certification.

## Objectives
Implement an image classifier with PyTorch (build and train a neural network on the flower dataset).
Convert the classifier into an application that others can use. The application should be a pair of Python scripts that run from the command line. The first file, ``train.py``, will train a new network on a dataset and save the model as a checkpoint. The second file, ``predict.py``, uses a trained network to predict the class for an input image.
